 * This class â€“ This class is our Team object which has teamName, teamWins, teamLosses, mascot, and returningPlayers.
 * The constructor utilizes the setters which each throw exceptions based on the validations required.
 * Each attribute for Team has exceptions to look for, as well as the Team object which checks for a total of 12 wins and losses combined.
 * The toString puts everything into words and displays after being initialized.
